#  Books 
A simple project to look up isbns on amazon, and add them to a goodreads shelf.  requires a credential file with the requisite keys for both Amazon and Goodreads APIs.  Depends on a csv of book titles and authors, which is not posted.  

The goodreads part borrows heavily from sefakilic's more featured implementation, availible here:  https://github.com/sefakilic/goodreads

The Amazon part makes use of yoavaviram's  library:  https://github.com/yoavaviram/python-amazon-simple-product-api
